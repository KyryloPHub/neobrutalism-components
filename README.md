## About 

I created this collection of components for people who want to learn more about neobrutalism style.

Inspired by [ui-snippets](https://ui.ibelick.com/)

## Future of this project

I think that's pretty much it for now. I doubt I will continue working on this project unless I get some new ideas. <br />
If you have any ideas about what I should add or fix, don't hesitate to open an issue, and we can talk about it. Thanks.
